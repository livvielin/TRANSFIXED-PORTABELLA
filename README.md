### Installing Dependencies

Ionic Setup

1. Run ```npm install``` from the app directory.
2. Run ```npm install``` from the the push-server directory.
3. Set up an [Ionic account](https://apps.ionic.io/signup).
4. Initialize the platform by running ```ionic add ionic-platform-web-client``` from the root directory.
5. Run ```ionic plugin add phonegap-plugin-push``` from the root directory.
6. Run ```ionic io init``` from the root directory.
7. Go to your [Ionic apps](https://apps.ionic.io) and navigate to the app you just created.  Get the app id from My Apps home page and the public and secret API keys under Settings->Keys in the app.
8. In the .io-config.json file in the app directory, set dev_push to false to run the app on an Android device, or to true to run the app on the desktop.  Set the app id and API keys.  Then set up a [GCM key](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/push-android-setup).  The file should look like the following:
```
{
  "dev_push": false,
  "app_id": APPID,
  "api_key": PUBLICKEY,
  "privateKey": SECRET,
  "gcm_key": GCMKEY
}
```
9. Run ```ionic config build```.

Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) website and sign up for an account.
2. In the homepage, create an app.
3. Click on Manage App and navigate to Login & Auth.  Check the box next to "Enable Email & Password Authentication."
4. In the app/www/js/services.js file, replace any instances of yotempest in the Database factory with your app name.  (There should be three instances, one each in ref, usersRef, and session)

* Note: Installation instructions have changed since the start of this project.  This is a beta product in flux.
